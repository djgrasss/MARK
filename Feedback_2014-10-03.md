Presentation Feedback (2014-10-03)
==================================

Dr. Palmeri Comments
--------------------
 * Need references on slides for all sources!
 * Great overview of background, specifications and constraints
 * Needed pictures / diagrams to help present approaches
 * Time: N/A (student had to leave midway; not your fault!)
 * Need stronger conclusion; end with a specific conclusion slide and actively
   solicit questions.

Class & TA Comments
-------------------
 * Diagrams or prototype would have been helpful
 * Is the BeagleBone overkill for your application?  Would variants of the Arduino meet your needs?
 * What are the software requirements?  Calibration?  UI?  Controls?
