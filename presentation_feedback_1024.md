Presentation Feedback
=====================
 * Power for amp circuit?
 * Probably do not need clipper between 5V regulator and Arduino, already regulated
 * Not sure about BJT section of circuit, needs to be more completely drawn and then discussed
 * Need details about testing protocol
 * What does the audio amplifier do? Why not some other type
 * Use diptrace for schematic
 * Careful you do not go too far from what is clinically usable
 * Something like the sputter coated at SMIF could coat the bars in gold
